## What features define a data driven business?

 When a company has data that is centralized and originazed the company is data driven. The data then needs to be acceseble for everyone in the company to use. Those people in the company can then use the data to clean and use tools to analyze the data futher. When the data is analyzed the data can be summarized in a BI tool for visualizations. Those visualuzations are then used to make data driven disisions. The company i chose in this assigment is steam (valve). Steam is a platform where you can buy and play games on. If you want to make and publish a game you can do that on steam. Steam offers a data platform to check on your game. You can check how people are playing your games, where they are stuck, what they buy, what do like and dislike, etc. This is a very data driven business because you can keep track of your data by using this platform and make disissions of these findings.
